# Face-Mask-Detection
 Face mask detector using Python, OpenCV, Keras and MobileNet


 This face mask detection model is trained using ***Keras***, ***TensorFlow***, ***OpenCV*** and an additional ***MobileNetV2*** architecture which makes it mode efficient and easy to deploy with embedded systems like Google Coral, Raspberry Pi
 
 Accuracy is upto **98%** - (without overfitting)
 
 Detection is faster and efficient.

 ***dataset -*** contains two sub-folders, one having images with mask and other having images without mask.
 
 ***face_detector -*** contains two files that are used to detect the face while testing the model
 
 ***Detector -*** is the actual saved model
 
 ***Detector.py -*** is the python file contains the model code
 
 ***VideoTester.py -*** is the python file contains code to test the model
 
 ***plot.png -*** is the graph showing accuracy and loss during its training
 
 ***requirements.txt -*** contain all the required library with specific version for this model.
